# Secure File Management System

## Introduction
The Secure File Management System is a web application designed to provide secure file encryption, decryption, and key management functionalities. Built using Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, this system allows users to encrypt files with a passphrase or a public key, decrypt files with the appropriate key, and generate key pairs for secure file transfer.

## Features
- **Passphrase-based Encryption and Decryption**: Secure your files with a passphrase.
- **Public and Private Key Generation**: Generate key pairs for asymmetric encryption.
- **Public Key Encryption and Private Key Decryption**: Encrypt files with a public key for secure sharing and decrypt with the private key.
- **File Integrity Verification**: Uses SHA-256 hashing to ensure the integrity of files during encryption and decryption processes.
